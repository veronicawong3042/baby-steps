# StormHacks 2024: Baby Steps
## By: Emily, Joar, Linda, Veronica

## Inspiration
During pregnancy, expectant mothers often face a flood of information from various sources, making it overwhelming and difficult to discern reliable advice. Inspired by the success of Duolingo in making language learning accessible and enjoyable, Baby Steps aims to simplify the pregnancy journey by providing a single, trustworthy platform for learning and support. The app was born out of a desire to offer expectant mothers an engaging and interactive way to gain essential knowledge, connect with others, and feel empowered throughout their pregnancy. By breaking down complex topics into manageable, daily lessons and fostering a community of support, Baby Steps ensures that every woman can navigate her pregnancy with confidence and ease.

## What it does
Baby Steps allows expectant mothers to learn more about any given topic relating to pregnancy and childbirth. Users are able to test their pre-existing knowledge as well as read informative, easily digestible pieces of information with our lesson plans. To navigate through the app, users can also utilize the glossary section to quickly skim through all potential topics that Baby Steps offers.

## How we built it
We built Baby Steps using Figma, React.js, React libraries and custom API hooks, SQLite, Node.js, Express.js, Cors, SASS, and JSON.

## Challenges we ran into
We had difficulty setting up the database which led to troubles when getting the content to display on the front-end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are all juniors in coding with three of us only within our first year of learning how to code at all so we are very proud of our accomplishment overall.

The back-ends are proud of the seamless integration between the front-end and back-end especially because of the struggles we had with it. We're proud of the scalability brought on by using SQLite. For front-end, we're proud of the Figma design and favicon.

## What we learned
We learned how to create a dynamic custom hook, gained a stronger understanding of react router dom, as well as implementing the basics of SQL in conjunction with Express.js.

## What's next for Baby Steps
In the future, we would like to add a mascot, and later adapt it into an AI assistant for users to ask questions outside the curriculum for quick access/response via chatbot. Additionally, expanding and further developing the quiz format to offer more variety in question types. Adding a page for user accounts would also be nice for the future. Users may use this profile to track their pregnancy as well through self-report.
